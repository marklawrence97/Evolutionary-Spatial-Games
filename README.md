# Evolutionary-Spatial-Games

# How to use

To run the application from the terminal, use the command 

 ```
 python frontend.py
 ```

Tkinter is used to create a GUI allowing a user to experiment with different evolutionary spatial games.

Numpy must be installed for this to run.

# Using the interface

To use the interface you must input a payoff matrix. Then you can configure the boundary conditions and neighbourhood 
condition for the cellular automata.

If the 'B invades A' box is unticked then you must add a distribution this will outline the proportion of strategy A in the population and the proportion of strategy B in the population.

Once everything is configured press draw to initialise the cellular automata, if everything looks configured correctly then press start to begin the animation.
